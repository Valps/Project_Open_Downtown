# Project_Open_Downtown

The main objective of Project Open Downtown is to create an equivalent
of the source code of Downtown District, namely "wil.mis" and ALL
missions therein.

To get the compiled code, just extract "wil.MIS" and the folder "wil"
together and run "wil.MIS" in the miss2.exe compiler (made by DMA Design).

To install this open source version of Downtown District into GTA2, just
move all contents of the folder "Compiled code" into /GTA2/data/

Alternatively, you can compile the source code and drag "wil.SCR"
into /GTA2/data/ and all other .SCR missions compiled files 
to /GTA2/data/wil/

There is a backup of the original .SCR files, compiled by the original
authors from DMA Design.

Feel free to modify the code and make cool things with them.

Greetings from Valps.

# Known issues

- There is a chance of the compiler crash or get a MAP_ZONE error when compiling the source code. It's an unknown occasional error, but isn't code fault. You just need to close miss2.exe, reopen it and try again.
